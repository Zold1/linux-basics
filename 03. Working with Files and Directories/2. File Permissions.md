# File Permissions

File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, and execute files and directories. Understanding and managing these permissions is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your system.

## Understanding File Permissions

In Linux, each file and directory has three types of permissions that apply to three categories of users:

### Categories of Users

- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: The group that owns the file.
- **Others**: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

### Types of Permissions

- **Read (`r`)**: Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing a directory's contents.
- **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying a file's contents or adding/removing files in a directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Allows running a file as a program or entering a directory.

### Permission Structure

File permissions are represented as a string of 10 characters. For example:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--
```

The characters represent the following:

1. The first character indicates the file type:
   - `-` for a regular file.
   - `d` for a directory.
   - `l` for a symbolic link.
2. The next three characters represent the owner's permissions.
3. The following three represent the group's permissions.
4. The last three represent others' permissions.

In the example `-rwxr-xr--`, the file is a regular file where:
- The owner has read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`).
- The group has read and execute permissions (`r-x`).
- Others have only read permissions (`r--`).

## Viewing File Permissions

To view the permissions of a file or directory, use the `ls -l` command:

```bash
ls -l filename.txt
```

The output will display the permissions, owner, group, size, and other details about the file:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Sep  2 14:32 filename.txt
```

## Modifying File Permissions

### Using `chmod`

The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. Permissions can be set using either symbolic or numeric modes.

#### Symbolic Mode

In symbolic mode, you specify the permission type (`r`, `w`, `x`) and the category (`u` for owner, `g` for group, `o` for others, `a` for all):

- **Grant Permissions**:

  ```bash
  chmod u+x filename.txt
  ```

  This command adds execute permissions for the owner.

- **Revoke Permissions**:

  ```bash
  chmod g-w filename.txt
  ```

  This command removes write permissions for the group.

- **Set Permissions Exactly**:

  ```bash
  chmod o=r filename.txt
  ```

  This command sets others' permissions to read only.

#### Numeric Mode

In numeric mode, permissions are represented by a three-digit number, where each digit corresponds to the permissions for the owner, group, and others:

- **`r` = 4**
- **`w` = 2**
- **`x` = 1**

You add the values to set the desired permissions. For example:

- **`7` = `rwx` (4+2+1)**
- **`6` = `rw-` (4+2)**
- **`5` = `r-x` (4+1)**
- **`4` = `r--` (4)**

To set permissions using numeric mode:

```bash
chmod 755 filename.txt
```

This command sets the permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`, where the owner can read, write, and execute, while the group and others can read and execute.

### Using `chown`

The `chown` command changes the ownership of a file or directory:

- **Change Owner**:

  ```bash
  chown newowner filename.txt
  ```

- **Change Group**:

  ```bash
  chown :newgroup filename.txt
  ```

- **Change Owner and Group**:

  ```bash
  chown newowner:newgroup filename.txt
  ```

## Special Permissions

### Setuid and Setgid

- **Setuid (`s`)**: When applied to an executable file, the file runs with the privileges of the file's owner, not the user running it. This is indicated by an `s` in the owner's execute position.

  ```bash
  chmod u+s filename
  ```

- **Setgid (`s`)**: When applied to a directory, new files created within inherit the group of the directory, rather than the primary group of the user who created the file. This is indicated by an `s` in the group's execute position.

  ```bash
  chmod g+s directory
  ```

### Sticky Bit

- **Sticky Bit (`t`)**: When set on a directory, only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or the root user can delete or rename files within the directory. This is commonly used on shared directories like `/tmp`. It is indicated by a `t` in the others' execute position.

  ```bash
  chmod +t directory
  ```

## Permission Pitfalls

- **Overly Permissive Files**: Setting permissions like `777` (read, write, and execute for everyone) can be a security risk. It allows any user to modify or execute the file.
  
- **Root Permissions**: Be cautious when modifying permissions as the root user. Incorrect settings can make critical system files inaccessible or executable, leading to system instability.

## Practical Examples

### Securing a Script

To create a script that only the owner can modify and execute, and others can only execute:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

### Protecting a Shared Directory

To allow users to create files in a shared directory but prevent them from deleting each other's files:

```bash
mkdir /shared
chmod 1777 /shared
```

### Setting a File for Execution with Owner's Privileges

To create a script that runs with the owner's privileges, regardless of who executes it:

```bash
chmod u+s script.sh
```

## Conclusion

File permissions in Linux are a powerful tool for controlling access to files and directories. By mastering commands like `chmod` and `chown`, and understanding the implications of special permissions like setuid, setgid, and the sticky bit, you can ensure your system is both functional and secure. Always consider the principle of least privilege when setting permissions, granting only the necessary access to minimize security risks.
